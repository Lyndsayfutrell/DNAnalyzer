Researchers are working to extract valuable information from such software to better understand human health and disease. Currently, we have a Command-Line-Interface (CLI) and are working on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will enable physicians to quickly and more easily interact with the software, enabling them to identify genetic mutations that may cause disease.</h1>
