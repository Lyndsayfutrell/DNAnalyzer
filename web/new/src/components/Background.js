    <h1 className="main--text background">The human genome is composed of over 3 billion base pairs, making human analysis nearly impossible. Consequently, using powerful computational and statistical methods to decode the functional information hidden in DNA sequences are necessary. The genome is also extremely intricate and contains a plethora of data, which need to be organized and converted into analyzable data appropriately. Current analytical tools and software make it arduous for both geneticists and physicians to do so, thus restricting them from acquiring crucial information to better understand humans.</h1>
